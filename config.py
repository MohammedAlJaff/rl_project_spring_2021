"""
In this file, you may edit the hyperparameters used for different environments.

memory_size: Maximum size of the replay memory.
n_episodes: Number of episodes to train for.
batch_size: Batch size used for training DQN.
target_update_frequency: How often to update the target network.
train_frequency: How often to train the DQN.
gamma: Discount factor.
lr: Learning rate used for optimizer.
eps_start: Starting value for epsilon (linear annealing).
eps_end: Final value for epsilon (linear annealing).
anneal_length: How many steps to anneal epsilon for.
n_actions: The number of actions can easily be accessed with env.action_space.n, but we do
    some manual engineering to account for the fact that Pong has duplicate actions.
